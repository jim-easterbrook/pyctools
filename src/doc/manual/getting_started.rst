Getting started
===============

If Pyctools has been installed correctly the :py:mod:`pyctools-editor <pyctools.tools.editor>` command should launch a program similar to that shown below.

.. image:: /images/editor_1.png

The exact appearance will depend on your computer's operating system and user preferences, but the main functional elements should be the same.

Adding components
-----------------

On the left hand side there is a list of Pyctools components and on the right there is a large empty space where components can be placed and connected, called the "graph area".
Click on ``zone`` in the component list to expand it, then drag ``ZonePlateGenerator`` onto the graph area.
A dialog box pops up asking you to give the new component a name, as shown below.

.. image:: /images/editor_2.png

Accept the suggested name by clicking the ``OK`` button.
A zone plate generator component has now been added to the graph area.

.. image:: /images/editor_3.png

You can move the component around by clicking and dragging it.
"Hovering" your mouse over the component should display a "tool tip" popup with the component's documentation.
Clicking on the component selects it and its border is shown dashed.
Selected components can be deleted with the computer's ``delete`` key.

Click on ``qt`` and drag a ``QtDisplay`` component to the graph area.

Connecting components
---------------------

Now click and drag the ZonePlateGenerator's ``output`` connector to the QtDisplay's ``input`` (or *vice versa*).
This connects the two components, as shown below.
(To delete the connection, select the link and press the ``delete`` key.
The easiest way to select the link is to click and drag across it to select an area of the graph that includes the link.)

Component configuration
-----------------------

Double click on the ZonePlateGenerator, or right-click on it and select ``configure`` from the pop-up menu.
This opens the component's configuration dialog, as shown below.
(You can move the dialog to any convenient position.)

.. image:: /images/editor_6.png

Set the following values in the configuration dialog:

* ``kx`` 0.5
* ``ky`` 0.5
* ``kx2`` 1.0
* ``ky2`` 1.0
* ``xlen`` 200
* ``ylen`` 200
* ``looping`` repeat

then click on the ``apply`` button.

Running the graph
-----------------

Clicking on the ``run graph`` button should start the components running.
Another window opens showing the video output from the ZonePlateGenerator.
This is the classic "static circular" zone plate test pattern.

.. image:: /images/editor_8.png

Using the zone plate configuration window, set the ``kt`` value to 0.1, then click on the ``apply`` button.
Now the zone plate should show some movement.
Hopefully your computer is powerful enough to generate a smoothly moving video.

.. image:: /images/editor_9.png

Being able to update the configuration while the graph is running makes it very easy to experiment with the zone plate generator.
Try setting the ``kt`` value to 0.9 instead of 0.1.

Saving the graph
----------------

Finally, you can save the graph, with all its connections and configuration, to use later.
The ``file`` menu has ``load script`` and ``save script`` actions, with the usual keyboard shortcuts.

Note that you can run your saved script directly, without running :py:mod:`pyctools-editor <pyctools.tools.editor>`.
If you've saved it as ``zone-plate.py`` you can run it with the command ``python zone-plate.py``.

Compound components
-------------------

The :py:class:`~pyctools.core.compound.Compound` component encapsulates a group of components.
This allows a few simple components to be assembled into something a bit more complicated that can be treated as a single component.

.. image:: /images/editor_10.png

Compound components are shown on the graph area with a dashed outline.

.. image:: /images/editor_11.png

The compound component's context menu includes an extra item ``Expand/contract``.
Expanding the component shows its internal components and linkages.
In this case the component is an image resizer made by pipelining a vertical resizer and a horizontal resizer, each with their own filter generator.

More components
---------------

A graph can contain many more components than in the simple examples shown above.
Here's something a bit more complicated.

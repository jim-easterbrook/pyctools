Pyctools
========

A picture processing algorithm development kit.

Pyctools is a collection of picture processing primitive components that you can easily interconnect to make complex algorithm simulations.
It works with stills or video, and utilises popular libraries such as `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_, `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and `OpenCV <http://opencv.org/>`_.

Example projects using pyctools include `pyctools-pal <https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/pyctools-pal>`_ (a simulation of the `Transform PAL decoder <http://www.jim-easterbrook.me.uk/pal/>`_) and `pyctools-demo <https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/pyctools-demo>`_ (demonstrations of some simple processing).

Documentation
-------------

The core Pyctools library and components are documented on `Read The Docs <http://pyctools.readthedocs.io/>`_.
If you install additional components you should build a local copy of the documentation to include the extra components.

Requirements
------------

Essential
^^^^^^^^^

* `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ version 2.7 or 3.x.
* `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ for its powerful multi-dimensional array object.
* `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_ for image file reading and writing. (The `pillow <http://python-pillow.github.io/>`_ fork of PIL is recommended.)
* `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_ to build fast extensions for Python.
* `gexiv2 <https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/gexiv2>`_ to handle metadata.
* `pgi <https://github.com/pygobject/pgi>`_ **or** `PyGObject <https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/>`_ Python wrapper for gexiv2.

Optional
^^^^^^^^

* `OpenCV <http://opencv.org/>`_ python bindings for advanced image processing.
* `FFmpeg <https://www.ffmpeg.org/>`_ to read and write video files.
* `rawkit <https://rawkit.readthedocs.io/>`_ to read raw image files.
* `PyQt5 <https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_ and `PyOpenGL <http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/>`_ graphic toolkit used by the Pyctools visual editor and the Qt display components.
* `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ and `mock <https://github.com/testing-cabal/mock>`_ to build local documentation.

Installation
------------

Please see `the documentation <http://pyctools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/installation.html>`_ for full details of how to install Pyctools and its requirements.

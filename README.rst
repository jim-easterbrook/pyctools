Pyctools
========

A picture processing algorithm development kit.

Pyctools is a collection of picture processing primitive components that you can easily interconnect to make complex algorithm simulations.
It works with stills or video, and utilises popular libraries such as `Python Imaging Library`_, NumPy_ and OpenCV_.

Example projects using pyctools include `pyctools-pal`_ (a simulation of the `Transform PAL decoder`_) and `pyctools-demo`_ (demonstrations of some simple processing).

Documentation
-------------

The core Pyctools library and components are documented on `Read The Docs`_.
If you install additional components you should build a local copy of the documentation to include the extra components.

Requirements
------------

Essential
^^^^^^^^^

* Python_ version 3.6 or later.
* NumPy_ for its powerful multi-dimensional array object.
* `Python Imaging Library`_ for image file reading and writing. (The pillow_ fork of PIL is recommended.)
* Cython_ to build fast extensions for Python.
* `python-exiv2`_ to handle metadata.

Optional
^^^^^^^^

* OpenCV_ python bindings for advanced image processing.
* FFmpeg_ to read and write video files.
* rawkit_ and/or rawpy_ to read raw image files.
* PyQt5_ and PyOpenGL_ graphic toolkit used by the Pyctools visual editor and the Qt display components.
* Sphinx_ to build local documentation.

Installation
------------

Please see `the documentation`_ for full details of how to install Pyctools and its requirements.
